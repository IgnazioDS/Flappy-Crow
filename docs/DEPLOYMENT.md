# Deployment

The game is a static site generated by Vite. The production bundle lives in `dist/`.

## GitHub Pages (primary)

This repo ships with `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to publish `dist/` on every push to `main`.

1) Push to `main`.
2) In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages and set Source to **GitHub Actions**.
3) The workflow publishes to `https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/`.

### Base path handling

`vite.config.ts` reads `VITE_BASE` for the `base` path. The Pages workflow sets:

```bash
VITE_BASE=/<repo-name>/
```

If you deploy under a different subpath, set `VITE_BASE` accordingly. For root-hosted
sites (Vercel, Netlify, custom domain), leave `VITE_BASE` unset so it defaults to `/`.

## Other hosts

- Vercel: `npm run build`, then deploy `dist/`.
- Netlify: build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist/`.

## Cache strategy

- Vite outputs hashed asset filenames, which are safe for long-term caching.
- `index.html` should not be cached aggressively so new releases propagate quickly.

## Preview deployments

GitHub Pages does not provide per-PR preview deployments by default.
Use `npm run preview` locally or a host with preview support if you need PR previews.

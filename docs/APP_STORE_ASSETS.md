# App Store Assets Prep

Use this guide to prepare the iOS assets before submission.

## Icons

- App icon file: `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-512@2x.png`
- Update the source artwork first, then replace the PNG above.
- Keep the icon square, 1024x1024, and avoid transparency.

## Launch Screen

- Storyboard: `ios/App/App/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard`
- Any referenced images should live under `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets`.

## Screenshots

- Follow `docs/app-store/screenshots/README.md`.
